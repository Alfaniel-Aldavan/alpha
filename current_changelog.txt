Note: this is just a memo pad to record changes and prepare the posts for the dev topics.

[list]
[li]added like display to the user's profile (Show content -> Likes received).[/li]
[li]Renamed confirm_() and alert_() to Eos_Confirm() and Eos_Alert() respectively. Urgent need for more JS refactorings...[/li]
[li]New BBCode [align=left|center|right|justify] - replaces the old left/center/right/justify tags which were consequently moved to the BBC compatibility addon. Reducing the number of bb codes helps a bit with the performance of parse_bbc().[/li]
[li]Boards can now have a custom icon frome {themedir}images/boards.[/li]
[li]Added option in BBCode configuration to load the LegacyBBC addon. This core addon can be used to re-add all SMF 2 compatible BBCodes that were removed from EOSAlpha.[/li]
[li]Some styling fixes to help with laggy scrolling (dynamically set overlays to position:fixed only when needed and revert to position:static after hiding them).[/li]
