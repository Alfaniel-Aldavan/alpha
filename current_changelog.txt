Note: this is just a memo pad to record changes and prepare the posts for the dev topics.

[list]
[li]Changed how posts from ignored members appear in the topic view and cleaned up the JS that handles ignored posts.[/li]
[li]New BBCode for column layout. [nobbc][columns=N]Your text[/columns][/nobbc] can be used to format the text with N columns
using CSS3 column-count property. A css class "bbc_columns" can be customized to tweak the column layout (except the
number of columns which is applied via an inline style and depends on the parameter passed to the tag). Note that this
needs a modern browser to show up properly and if a browser does not support the column-count property, the paragraph(s)
will appear just like any normal text.[/li]
[li]The [nobbc][justify][/nobbc] tag can be used to format a paragraph with CSS justify:all property.[/li]
[li]The [nobbc][class=foo]Text[/class][/nobbc] tag can be used to format text with the given CSS class. The text
will be wrapped in a <div> using the parameter as its CSS class.[/li]
[li]Simplified postbit_normal and postbit_blog a bit.[/li]
[li]Scrapped the concept of page boards. The topic layout can now be set on a per-topic base when posting a new topic
or modifying the first message of any topic (a permission to post with non-standard layout will probably be needed).[/li]
[li]Some reorganization of postbit templates (again...)[/li]
