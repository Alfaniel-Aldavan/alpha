It is a modified version of the well known SMF forum software that is now released
under a open source compatible BSD license.

http://www.simplemachines.org/ is where the original SMF can be found.

The goal of this project is to create a more modern version of SMF with an emphasize
on enduser usability. 

Some things that are already implemented or planned are:

* A like system
* A tagging system
* A completely new theme, HTML 5 compliant and targeted at modern 
  browsers
* Ajax enhancements for previewing member profiles, topics and more.
* dynamic auto-refreshing relative time stamps.
* sphinx search support
* removed legacy code. This will be PHP5 and MySQL only
